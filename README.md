Online fuel delivery is a growing service where customers can order fuel to be delivered directly to their location—whether it's a home, office, or business. It provides convenience and time-saving benefits for people who don’t want to visit a traditional gas station. This service is gaining popularity because of its ability to serve both individual consumers and businesses (e.g., fleets) in a streamlined and contactless manner.
